# YouTube-Video-Performance-Predictor-ML

### The Story

Arjun runs a tech review YouTube channel with 50,000 subscribers. He spends hours designing thumbnails because he believes they make or break a video.

His friends say he is overthinking it. The content matters more, they argue.

Arjun decides to settle this with data. He tracks his last 30 videos and notes down the thumbnail click-through rate (CTR) and the total views after 30 days.

He wonders: *"If my thumbnail gets a 8% CTR, how many views can I expect?"*

Your job is to help Arjun build a **prediction model** using Machine Learning.
